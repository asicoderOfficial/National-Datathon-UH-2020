# National-Datathon-UH-2020
This repository contains the final work sent to the organization of the competition by the Astralaria team, on the Minsait Land Classification challenge, representing the Polythecnic University of Valencia, formed by Asier Serrano Aramburu (sophomore) and Mario Campos Mochol√≠ (junior). If you want to see the original repo, with all commits, go to my fork from Polaryti, 'UniversityHack-2020'.

### Astralaria.pdf
PDF file made by using LaTeX, explaining the problem, previous work done and the final model presented. Written in spanish.

### Fase Nacional. Comentarios Astralaria.pdf
PDF file that constatates our final position and accuracy result. It also provides some possible improvements from the organization.

### UPV_Astralaria.txt
Text file containing the final prediction.

### Scripts/Astralaria.py
Py file with the final model. We would love to have presented a Jupyter Notebook, but it was not possible due to some problems with it.

The rest was also sent to support our work and show how much effort we had put in it.

Finally, we could not get to the top 3, but qualified for the final national round, becoming the best team in our university. If you want to check it, open the 'Certificate.pdf' file that proves it.

Thank you for checking my repo!
